# CoD MW3 Server Launcher

## About

Tool to __configure and launch__ a __dedicated server__ for  
the game __Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3__.  

Made to be used in our __Informatics Class__ back in 2018 to play __Infected__.  
~ Only after we finished our Pascal programming assignment, of course.  

**_The game is not bundled with this tool!_**

## Instructions

* Copy these files into MW3 root directory
* You must have a dedicated server downloaded from the steam 'tools' section
* Run Kalafar.exe and select ruleset
* Click Launch, run the game, join server
* Enjoy

## Features / Limits

* Can only set up LAN dedicated server (made for lan-parties)
* Supported gamemodes:
    * TDM
    * FFA
    * Gun Game
    * Infected
* One of the custom classes features a juggernaut suit.

## TODO

* Add structured .zip to the downloads section so this repo does not  
hold all the binaries
